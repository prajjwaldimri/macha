## Social Media Apps Fallout

- Ello was initially invite-only, and it buckled under the unanticipated spike in demand. Some users also criticized the site’s [lack of privacy controls](https://notyourexrotic.tumblr.com/post/98292236476/goodbye-ello-privacy-safety-and-why-ello-makes). By the time Ello recovered, people’s curiosity had waned.
- Despite the hype, Mastodon’s sign-up process was tricky to grasp, requiring users to choose a server “instance” that hosted their posts. (These independently operated instances are the building blocks for a _federated_ social network, rather than a centralized one, stored on a single company’s set of servers.) The temporary shutdown on Mastodon’s main instance didn’t help with momentum.
- When Vero suddenly entered the spotlight, journalists and other observers raised questions about founder Ayman Hariri, whose family had run a now-defunct construction company in Saudi Arabia that reportedly left thousands of employees to [live in labor camps without payment](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-labour-foreign/abandoned-in-saudi-desert-camps-migrant-workers-wont-leave-without-pay-idUSKCN10T1M3). (Vero says that he quit the business in 2013 and sold his stake in 2014, before its 2016 collapse.) Users also criticized the service for making account deletion difficult; the company has since made it a simpler self-serve process.
- Observers tended to [fixate on App.net’s Twitter-like qualities](https://www.wired.com/2013/08/the-great-app-net-mistake/), rather than its broader platform ambitions, and the prospect of charging \$50 per year for the service led to allegations of [elitism](https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/08/09/race-class-app-net-the-beginning-of-white-flight-from-facebook-twitter/). Within two years, subscriptions dropped off, the founders moved on, and the service entered maintenance mode.
- Path never really took off in Western markets, and it didn’t help that the startup was caught uploading users’ address books without permission in 2012. (This led to an Federal Trade Commission fine and biennial privacy audits.) Still, the app became popular in Southeast Asia and was acquired by Daum Kakao, the makers of KakaoTalk, [in 2015](http://www.businessinsider.com/kakao-talk-buys-path-2015-5).
